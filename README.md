Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
